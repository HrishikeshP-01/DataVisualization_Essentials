# Data visualization essentials

## Data visualization
- A means to convey info using visual representation
- Tells the story of the data 
- Allows the audience to gain an understanding of what the data is saying
- Need to be useful for someone
- It has to be explained logically & coherently

During data visualization we should never misrepresent or try to obscure the data. It has to be clear & concise.

## Data visualization phases
1. *Exploration phase* – understand the data to find the story it’s telling
2. *Explanation phase* – tell the story

## Know the audience
- Who are you presenting to?
- How well do they know the data?
- What is their level of expertise?
- What info do they require & do different audience members require different information?
- Are they from different cultures or speak different languages?
- Are there visual impairments? This affects the colors & sizes you can use.

After you answer the above questions:

Create data visualizations for the audience & ensure that they understand it & are engaged by it. Channel your narrative to them specifically.

## Gestalt Principles of Perception
People digest data under the Gestalt theory which attempts to explain how we generate meaningful perceptions. Some principles are:
- *Principle of proximity* – when individuals perceive an assortment of objects, they perceive objects close to each other as being part of the same group. In other words, if things are close to each other, people perceive them as being part of the same group.
- *Principle of similarity* – if things look the same, people perceive them as the same type.
- *Enclosure & continuity* – things with a boundary or continuation are seen as a group
- *Closure* – individuals perceive structures as shapes, letters or pictures & even when these structures have gaps, they perceive them as being whole i.e, their brains fill in the gaps

## Traits of good data visualization
- Data presented is useful for the audience
- Data presented is usable by the audience
- They are pleasant to use
- They are highly accessible
- Visualization provides the right info to audience
- Provide rapid response when users interact with it
- Scalable – users can zoom/scale & easily explore your visualizations
- Communicates & presents data in a comprehensive way
- Enables analysis of data – supports decision making & answers the questions of users
- Make large sets of data clear & coherent
- Shows multiple levels – allows user to see the big picture while having the option to dig deeper
- Don’t distort the data
- A good data visualization makes the audience think about the data & not the way it was presented

**Infographics** – graphics are pre-generated, it’s more artistic, usually contains static data
**Data visualization** – the algorithm can crunch no:s in real-time to provide interactive visualizations, less artistic, can contain dynamic data
