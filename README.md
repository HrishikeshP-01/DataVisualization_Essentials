# Data visualization essentials

## Data visualization
- A means to convey info using visual representation
- Tells the story of the data 
- Allows the audience to gain an understanding of what the data is saying
- Need to be useful for someone
- It has to be explained logically & coherently

During data visualization we should never misrepresent or try to obscure the data. It has to be clear & concise.

## Data visualization phases
1. *Exploration phase* – understand the data to find the story it’s telling
2. *Explanation phase* – tell the story

## Know the audience
- Who are you presenting to?
- How well do they know the data?
- What is their level of expertise?
- What info do they require & do different audience members require different information?
- Are they from different cultures or speak different languages?
- Are there visual impairments? This affects the colors & sizes you can use.
